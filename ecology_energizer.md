Going and Going - The Ecology of the Energizer
-----------------------------------------------

Heya omae. Mac here. This is the first post of a series on technocritters. I find them fascinating, and knowing about them may save your bacon because OPFOR will use them creatively and so should you. Oh, and they're cute, right.

First, what's a Techno-Critter
===============================

Many have heard of awakened animals, like the spirit bear or unicorn. A lot fewer have heard of emergent creatures. Part biological, part resonance infused, they can be found everywhere. 

They all have some traits in common:
- They consume data either in place of, or in addition to food
- They interact with resonance
- They aren't magic. So far we have not found a critter that's both awakened and emergent.

Other than that they vary greatly:
- Some can even generate their own host
- Some are trainable, useful for runners and OPFOR alike
- Some reject any training

>> Sorry G. Yogis are real useful,,they give good bounty

The Energizer
==============

The emergent species of rabbit are collectively called __Energizers__, as in the pre-crash advert bunny symbol.

Up until recently there was only one species encountered. That species has now mutated into the JackedRabbit, and three other subspecies have been found.

There are four total subspecies recorded so far:
- Angryora - An emergent Anghora. Voracious with the attitude of a wolverine.
- Fuzzing Lop - An emergent Lop that defends itself with greatly increased noise while eating. 
- Diggers - The most social veriety, able to make a host when they gather.
- JackedRabbit - The most common variety, relatively harmless and sometimes useful.

What They Look Like
====================

Angryora are about twice the size of the Angora rabbits they emerged from. All speciments found so far have long black fur. This fur is not hair gut strong and mono-thin flexible meta cables. When an angryora is connected the cables will wave in an agitated manner, extending out a foot from the rabbit. The effect of brushing up against these cables is like brushing up against a monofilament whip. The angryora will defend itself by launching itself through the air with its powerful legs, ramming adversaries to cut them with its fur.  It does 

What They Eat
===============

The answer to what Angryora eat is, well, anything they want Chummer.
