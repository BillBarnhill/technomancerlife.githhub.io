Going and Going - The Ecology of the Energizer
-----------------------------------------------

Heya omae. Mac here. This is the first post of a series on technocritters. I find them fascinating, and knowing about them may save your bacon because OPFOR will use them creatively and so should you. Oh, and they're cute, right.

>> So cute. Right up until they munge that 30k nY of paydata before you can sell it
>> Netcat

First, what's a Techno-Critter
===============================

Many have heard of awakened animals, like the spirit bear or unicorn. A lot fewer have heard of emergent creatures. Part biological, part resonance infused, they can be found everywhere. 

They all have some traits in common:
* They consume data either in place of, or in addition to food
* They breed like, well, rabbits chummer. Go figure. Jackedrabbits breed the fastest of the bunch. Angryoras much slower than regular rabbits though.
* They interact with resonance
* They aren't magic. So far we have not found a critter that's both awakened and emergent.

>> Thank whatever powers there are for that. Fast breeding Angryora would be serious drek.
>> Slamm-O

Other than that they vary greatly:
- Some can even generate their own host
- Some are trainable, useful for runners and OPFOR alike
- Some reject any training 

>> Reject training..yeah, Yogis anyone?
>> G-Nome

>> Sorry G. Yogis are real useful, they give good bounty when dead
>> Slamm-o

The Energizer
==============

The emergent species of rabbit are collectively called __Energizers__, as in the pre-crash advert bunny symbol.

Up until recently there was only one species encountered. That species has now mutated into the JackedRabbit, and three other subspecies have been found.

There are four total subspecies recorded so far:
- Angryora - An emergent Anghora. Voracious with the attitude of a wolverine.
- Fuzzing Lop - An emergent Lop that defends itself with greatly increased noise while eating. 
- Diggers - The most social veriety, able to make a host when they gather.
- JackedRabbit - The most common variety, relatively harmless and sometimes useful.

What They Look Like
====================

__Angryora__ are about twice the size of the Angora rabbits they emerged from. All speciments found so far have long black fur and long ears. This fur is not hair gut strong and mono-thin flexible meta cables. When an angryora is connected the cables will wave in an agitated manner, extending out a foot from the rabbit. The effect of brushing up against these cables is like brushing up against a monofilament whip. The angryora will defend itself by launching itself through the air with its powerful legs, ramming adversaries to cut them with its fur. Their icon looks like a normal rabbit with black fur. Some seem to be touched with Dark Resonance.

__Fuzzing Lops__ are the size of the regular rabbit, with soft grey fur and long ears. Their icons are a rabbit sized cloud of electric snow.

__Diggers__ are also the size of a regular rabbit, with dark brown fur. They have short ears. Their icons are a metal rabbit with exaggerated large front paws and digging claws.

__Jacked Rabbits__ are the smallest, about half the size of a regular rabbit. They are usually albino. They also tend to be the smartest of the species, and the slowest breeding, showing intelligence similar to dolphins. Their icons are of a size 1 bipedal white rabbit. They are extremely trainable (+2 tricks), but also tend to be kleptomaniacs when they go into heat (3 days out of every month) - both in the physical reality and the Matrix.


What and Where They Eat
========================

The answer to what __Angryora__ eat is, well, anything they want Chummer - well, not quite - thankfully. The angryora likes blood, and data. They also tend to hunt in packs of 5-9 Angryora. An Angryora will gnaw its kill to get at the blood, then lap that up and ignore other parts of the carcass. It can eat any data, but really prefers sprites and technosapients, and use their innate data spike ability to disrupt the sprite and then eat its substance before that substance returns to the Resonance. Angryora can usually be found in in slums, preying on the homeless. They also can be found lurking in the basement of seedier gathering places, and universities. 

__Fuzzing Lops__ are herbivores when not munging data. They especially like mushrooms, mosses, and fungi. They prefer data in the form of communication messages, though they can eat any data. As a result they can be found around (and in dens under) satellite uplinks, transmitter towers, and cables. Because of their diet they also are often found underground in unmaintained tunnels with both fungi and cables. They will create warrens in trash piles if no earth is reachable, but prefer digging their warrens in the ground or nesting in existing vents/tunnels. They are less social than the other species, so you typically only find 2-4 together. Fuzzing Lops exude Noise, raising the the Noise around the Lop by +2 within 5m. The Noise is raised for each Lop, and stacks. 

__Diggers__ have sharp claws used for digging, and are capable of digging through stone given enough time. They are herbivores, and like eating roots and flower bulbs. They prefer living in the wild, on the outskirts of cities, and are capable of making large and deep warrens. Each Digger naturally creates a very small host (one room in an oversized VR warren - the room is big enough for a human to stand in). The data they prefer to eat is files. Individual Diggers have been known to range up to fifty miles in order to find data files. When a Digger manages to find files it will copy them to its host and then return to its warren, where it will make many copies of the files and all the Diggers will feed on the files. Autopsies have shown Diggers to have an infallible sense of direction via a magnetic field sense. Two or more Diggers within 100m will have their hosts connect to form one larger host. Since these are the most social of the species, with warrens spotted in the wild containing hundreds of individuals, some of these joined hosts can be very large indeed. Diggers will not eat or copy files encrypted with fractal wavelet compression.

__JackedRabbits__ are herbivores, eating anything vegetable but preferring carrots and celery. JackedRabbits eat noise and marks. The noise within 5m of a JackedRabbit is at -2 as a result. This does not stack if more than one JackedRabbit is together. They are attracted to, but do not eat, AR fashion. Some JackedRabbits have been seen wearing stolen bits of AR fashion in the Matrix, though this has not been verified.

>> Sure. Pull the other one.
>> Netcat

>> I want to see one with a pocket watch. That's late for a date.
>> Slamm-O

Uses
=====

__Angryora__ are starting to be used as guard animals around data warehouse facilities as a protection against technomancers, to neutralize their sprite advantage while also providing physical protection. They are more trainable than hellhounds, smaller, and cheaper to take care of.

__Fuzzing Lops__ are also being used by some corporations to create noise barriers. 

>> I saw an Ares Firewatch Spider that had attack trained three of these to swarm a target and latch on.
>> Netcat

__Diggers__ are being used as data havens, much in the way ancient BitTorrent was used. Files are split into chunks, encrypted in a way so the Diggers don't eat the files and you need the key to reassemble the files. Then many copies of the file chunks are made and inserted into the Digger's hosts. The Diggers are then tagged so they can be found again, and then let back into their warren. 

__JackedRabbits__ have become fashionable as Decker or Technomancer pets, though that popularity often wanes when their kleptomania manifests. Their extreme trainability and intelligence have led some runners to use them as assistants and watch dogs, similar to how Bastet cats are used. Curiously, Bastet Cats and JackedRabbits tend to get along and cohabitate well.
