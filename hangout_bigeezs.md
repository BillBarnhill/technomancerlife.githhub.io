Runner Hangout - Biggee Z's Cajun Pub
--------------------------------------

A few decades ago the street mage Bigee Z transplanted from New Orleans with 
nothing but an Ares Predator and his family's Beignet recipe. He retired last 
year and sunk a big chunk of his savings into his dream, a slice of New Orleans 
smack dab in the middle of Renton with Beignets to rival the best in the Big Easy. 
This is a rundown on what is sure to become a favorite runner hangout.
 
The Place
==========

The place is expansive, and done up all in mahogany. A long bar lines the west side of the pub, with plenty of seats. A stage in on the north wall, with an old fashioned standing mike and baby grande piano. In front of the stage a a number of well spaced tables, each set for four people. On the east wall are a set of comfortable booths. Stained glass chandeliers serve as lighting, usually turned down low.

There is always entertainment. Either it's Lily playing music, or it's Johnny doing Jazz on the Sax. If it's Johnny there are always spare instruments in racks on the stage and customers are welcome to come up and jam.  The place has a reputation as a somewhere a number of big time musicians like to come and jam, and the runner clientele usually keeps away the tourists.

The People
===========

The place is run by __Biggee Z__ himself of course. The blue skinned Fomori is large, even for his species. A 3rd initiate hermetic street mage who follows Raccoon and specializes in manipulation spells, he's mostly given up on his old Shadowrunning career, where he was known as BZ, for Bravo Zulu, a holdover from his military career. He supplements the income from the pub by moonlighting occasionally as a fixer (Connection 5). 

__Lily__ is a tall glass of elf with a voice of gold and looks to go with it. She specializes in covers of Ella Fitzgerald, and does them very well. She seems to know everyone, and everyone loves talking with her (Information Broker, Connection 6). She and Biggee have an on-again off-again thing.

__Bobby__ is the usual bartender, unless one of his two boys are tending. Bobby is an ex street sam, near full-borg conversion. He doesn't say much, but is an amazing listener and even better mixologist. If it's been made he's likely heard of it. If you can stump him your drink is free.

__Johhny__ is a retired Mystic Adept and Face, a rockerboy who almost made it to the big time if he hadn't punched the Johnson manager who tried to swindle him.
